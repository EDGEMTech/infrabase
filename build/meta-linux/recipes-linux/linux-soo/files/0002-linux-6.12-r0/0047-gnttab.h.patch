+ * A few words about the grant tables: 
+ * 
+ * Each domain has a grant table which keeps the reference to
+ * shared pages.
+ * 
+ * The normal approach consists in the container domain which asks
+ * for a shared page. The container gets a grant reference which will be used
+ * by the taget domain (Linux normally). The Linux domain can then ask 
+ * the hypervisor to get a physical (extra-domain) address in order to access the
+ * granted page.
