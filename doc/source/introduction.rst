Introduction
============

``Infrabase`` provides the developer with a base environment to deal with embedded software to be deployed on
different hardware and emulated boards.

``Infrabase`` harnesses the power of BitBake's highly modular, recipe-driven architecture while seamlessly integrating prebuilt packages into the BitBake ecosystem. This approach is grounded in years of hands-on experience with R&D projects and embedded Linux development, where the typical software stack includes:

- A bootloader like U-Boot
- The Linux kernel
- The root filesystem
- A set of user-space applications
